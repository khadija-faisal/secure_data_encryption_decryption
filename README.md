🔑 Usage Instructions
Register:
Go to the "Register" page, choose a unique username and a strong password.

Login:
Use your credentials on the "Login" page.

Store Data:
After logging in, go to "Store Data", enter your credentials again, and securely store sensitive information.

Retrieve Data:
Go to "Retrieve Data" to view your decrypted content after entering credentials.

Logout:
Securely log out of the session using the "Logout" option.


Clean sidebar navigation.

📌 Security Notes
Passwords are never stored directly, only hashed using salted PBKDF2.

Data is encrypted using Fernet with a unique session key.

JSON file stores user data but does not expose raw passwords or plaintext data.
